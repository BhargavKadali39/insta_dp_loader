# insta_dp_loader
Everyone out there struggling to check out the display picture of any Instagram accounts I got you.
Using this simple Python program, you can download and view any Instagram profile display picture with a username.


To check the downloaded image go to the folder where you saved the program and there will be a new folder created with the username you gave. The .jpg file will be available in that folder.
Feel free to contact in case of bugs.

Use below line to install required python module

    pip install instaloader
